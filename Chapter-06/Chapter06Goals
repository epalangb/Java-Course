A request has been made for an application to manage the bagging of products for online supermarket orders at sOOPer.

Currently, there are two types of containers: bags and boxes. Boxes are rectangular and can hold "any weight," while bags have a maximum weight limit. In both cases, the volume is determined by their dimensions, and various sizes are available.

Supermarket products are divided into several categories: Food, Hygiene, Household Cleaning, and Pet Supplies. Food products are further subdivided into Frozen, Fresh, and Non-Perishable items.

Each product has a specific volume and weight, which must be considered as "occupied" when bagged.

There are category restrictions:

Food products cannot be mixed with other categories.
Hygiene products cannot be mixed with food products.
Household cleaning products cannot be mixed with either food or pet supplies.
In the first version of this application, it is not necessary to optimize distribution or account for temperatures or expiration dates.
